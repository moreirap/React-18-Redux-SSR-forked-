This is the big\n        improvement in the initial React 18 release, you don't have to wait for\n        ALL js to be available before parts of the site can become responsive.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The two buttons share the same Redux-state, but the one in the top\n        becomes responsive first. If you click that while the button in this\n        Post is not responsive, you can see that the count here does not update\n        since it is not hydrated yet. This is called tearing, and is expected to\n        sometimes happen temporarily when components hydrate at different times\n        (though this example makes it very obvious).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There is currently a bug however. When tearing, this Post-components\n        button tries to hydrate with a different state than it was rendered with\n        on the server (because count has updated), leading to a hydration\n        mismatch (open the console to see the warning). This is planned to be\n        fixed in the next major release of Redux.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA/BA;AAwCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
